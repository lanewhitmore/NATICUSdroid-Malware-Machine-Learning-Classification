## Project Objectives

Classifying malware or non-malware applications on Android OS. This project will primarily try to address Android malware problems by finding a prediction model with the most precise classification model to identify the most potential malware possible from application permission. Data from Mathur, 2022 at the University of Toledo.

## Project Description

The dataset has been acquired from Mathur at the University of Toledo. The dataset contains application permissions and whether or not that application is malware. A model classifying the Malware class with 99.6% precision also reveals the most important variables when classifying the applications.
